//! # 5 CALibration Subsystem
//! This subsystem has the function of performing system calibration.
//!
//! Instrument CALibration commands tend to be very class specific. Such commands properly
//! belong in Volume 4 “Instrument Classes”. Therefore, expanded commands for controlling
//! instrument calibration may not be found in Volume 2 “Command Reference”.
