//! # 7 DIAGnostic Subsystem
//! The purpose of the DIAGnostic subsystem is to provide a tree node for all of the instrument
//! service and diagnostic routines used in routine maintenance and repair. The actual
//! commands in this subsystem are considered instrument-specific, and therefore are not
//! included in this document. Instrument designers are free to add service and diagnostic
//! commands to meet the needs of individual instruments.
