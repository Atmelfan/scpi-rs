//! # 10 HCOPy
//! The Hard COPy subsystem controls the setup of plotting and printing to an external device.
//! The Hard COPy subsystem does not perform any data formatting, that is it does not convert
//! the data from one representation to another, such as COMPlex to POLar. Instead HCOPy
//! adds the necessary page formatting (dependent upon the hard copy device language) to turn
//! the data into an acceptable form for the hard copy device.
